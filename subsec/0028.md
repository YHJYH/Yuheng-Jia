### Statistics
[bivariate normal distribution](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BivariateNormalDistribution.html)(2 independent random variables): Rice sec 3.3 Example F.<br>
- marginal distribution of one of the two vairables;
- conditional distribution of one of the two variables: Rice sec 3.5.2 Example C.
- covariance & correlation: Rice sec 4.3 Example F.
- conditional mean/expectation & conditional variance: Rice sec 4.4.1 Example B.
