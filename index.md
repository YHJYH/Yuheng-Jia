2. COMP0086 Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning (Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit)
3. COMP0090 Introduction to Deep Learning
4. STAT0028 Statistical Modelling and Data Analysis
5. COMP0089 Reinforcement Learning (Google Deepmind)
6. COMP0175 Statistical Learning Theory
7. COMP0087 Statistical Natural Language Processing
8. COMP0081 Applied Machine Learning
